# 🚗 Speed Detection AI using YOLOv11

This project is an **AI-powered Speed Detection System** built using **YOLOv11** for object detection and custom backend/frontend integration.  
It automatically detects vehicles in video feeds, tracks their motion, and estimates their speed in real-time.

## ⚙️ Features

✅ Detects and tracks vehicles in real-time  
✅ Calculates approximate vehicle speed using frame distance and time  
✅ Uses **YOLOv11** for highly accurate object detection  
✅ Has a **custom backend** for processing video input  
✅ Includes a **frontend UI** (Gradio / Flask / Streamlit) for visualization

## 🚀 How to Run

### 1️⃣ Clone this repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mfurqaniftikhar/Speed-Detection-AI-using-YOLOv11.git
cd Speed-Detection-AI-using-YOLOv11
2️⃣ Install dependencies
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
3️⃣ Run the application
bash
Copy code
python main.py
🧩 Model Info
The YOLOv11 model is pre-trained for vehicle detection.
You can fine-tune or replace it with your own custom-trained model (place it inside the /models folder).
