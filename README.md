🚗 Speed Detection AI using YOLOv11
This project is an AI-powered Speed Detection System built using YOLOv11 for object detection and custom backend/frontend integration.
It automatically detects vehicles in video feeds, tracks their motion, and estimates their speed in real-time.

🚀 How to Run
1️⃣ Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/mfurqaniftikhar/Speed-Detection-AI-using-YOLOv11.git
cd Speed-Detection-AI-using-YOLOv11
2️⃣ Install dependencies
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt

🧩 Model Info
The YOLOv11 model is pre-trained for vehicle detection.
You can fine-tune or replace it with your own custom-trained model (place it inside the /models folder).
